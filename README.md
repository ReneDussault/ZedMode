# UPDATE
TryHackMe has finally released a native dark mode for their website!
As a result, this add-on will no longer be actively developed. 
It will remain available on Mozilla's store for a while for those who enjoy using it. 

However, I plan to unlist it in the near future. 
Probably somewhere in 2025. 
The source code will still be available on this GitHub page for anyone interested. 

Thank you to everyone who tried ZedMode! 
This project has been a great learning experience, especially in JavaScript, CSS, and automation.
